                Although brief, my time working with programming languages has
                changed the direction of my life, and I look forward to where
                it will lead me.

                <h2>Exposure</h2>
                <p>
                    The first time I had been opened up to the idea of coding was
                    when my brother earned his Bachelor's in Computer Science. Not
                    that I had any idea what coding was at this point in
                    time, but it would give me some exellent direction when I was
                    in much need of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second time, however, I had actually gotten to see
                    programming up close in my high school's robotics club.
                    Despite being in closer proximty, I was working on the
                    physical aspect of the robot, and not the software
                    controlling it, with only the ability to see others make
                    it. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend for long due to
                    transportation to and from school.

                <h2>Getting My Hands Dirty</h2>
                <p>
                    Now at this stage in my life I was in college with the goal
                    of graduating with a mechanical engineering degree, and in
                    the first semester of my sophmore year I accidentally
                    signed up for the Computer Science coding class instead of
                    the coding class set up for other majors (much harder and 
                    as stated earlier I had no coding experience). The class 
                    was rough, but I was finally able to put coding as a skill 
                    after learning a fair amount of C++. As it turns out though
                    , this semester also happened to be my last due to financial 
                    troubles.

                <p>
                    Fresh out of college, and working two jobs, I didn't want 
                    to quit my education, and while I didn't enjoy the class itself
                     I was certaintly intriqued by programming. So, I set out 
                    onto the internet to teach myself. I went to websites like 
                    codecademy, hackerrank, coursera, and free code camp, 
                    learning more C++ along with other languages such as html, 
                    css, and python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was great, and all, but I was currently not working 
                    towards any career. I wasn't sure if I wanted to learn a 
                    trade, return to college, or change my course for coding. 
                    This is when my brother nudged me towards coding saying 
                    he knew a few people he worked with who had gone through 
                    a program called LaunchCode based here in St. Louis. 
                    Spoiler alert, here I am learning more skills in python, 
                    html, and soon to be more. I'm glad I have this opportunity, 
                    and am excited to see where it will take me.

                <h2>Where I Hope It Will Take Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, my end goal is to end up in cyber security with 
                    plan b as a back-end web developer. I think it would be 
                    satisfying to have my work help and protect people, however
                     I feel this could also be accomplished with a non-profit 
                    organization. I may not know now, but I'm sure it'll be 
                    easier to decide once I know a little bit more about coding
                     and how it interacts with jobs.
